Analysis
- Decode direction of upcoming saccade
    - To make sure that results don't depend on movements of the eyes,
    and the corresponding dipole movements, we should ensure that the
    *previous* eye movement is non systematically related to the next
    one. Maybe include a term in the model for the previous movement 
    direction? 
- Inverted encoding model (or Forward encoding model) for eye movements
- Contrast decoding of first fixation to an object, with decoding
of the last fixation to an object.
    - The expectations/predictions/priors are weaker for the first 
    fixation, so this analysis should be informative about predictions.
    - But we probably won't have enough trials to do this
- Make sure we don't find spurious results based on sequential dependence
    - If someone always looks from the car to the cat, then we'll be able
    to decode before the saccade based on the current fixation.
    - We can take care of this by balancing the transition matrix, and 
    tossing extra trials.
- Does alpha power topography predict saccade direction?
