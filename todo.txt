Experiment script
- do we have enough incorrect responses?
    - Longer pause before memory probe?
    - perceptual mask?
- automatic drift correction once every couple minutes
    - different fixation during drift correction

Analysis
- Decode direction of upcoming saccade
    - To make sure that results don't depend on movements of the eyes,
    and the corresponding dipole movements, we should ensure that the
    *previous* eye movement is non systematically related to the next
    one. Maybe include a term in the model for the previous movement 
    direction?
