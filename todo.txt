Experiment script
- feedback after each trial
- do we have enough incorrect responses?

- automatic drift correction once every couple minutes
    - different fixation during drift correction
- responses on two fingers of the right hand (not two hands)
- insert pauses for recording multiple trials


Analysis
- Artifact rejection
    - Figure out pipeline for manual rejection and ICA
- Decode direction of upcoming saccade
