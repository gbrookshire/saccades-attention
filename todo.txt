Experiment script
- do we have enough incorrect responses?
    - Longer pause before memory probe?
    - perceptual mask?
- automatic drift correction once every couple minutes
    - different fixation during drift correction

Analysis
- Decode direction of upcoming saccade
    - To make sure that results don't depend on movements of the eyes,
    and the corresponding dipole movements, we should ensure that the
    *previous* eye movement is non systematically related to the next
    one. Maybe include a term in the model for the previous movement 
    direction? 
- Inverted encoding model (or Forward encoding model) for eye movements
- Contrast decoding of first fixation to an object, with decoding
of the last fixation to an object.
    - The expectations/predictions/priors are weaker for the first 
    fixation, so this analysis should be informative about predictions.
    - But we probably won't have enough trials to do this
