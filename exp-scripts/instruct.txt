In this study, you'll see four images appear together on the screen for several seconds.
Your job is to memorize where each image appears.
After a few seconds, the images will disappear and a dot will appear somewhere on the screen. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see two images which might have appeared at the position of the dot.
Choose which image was at the position of the dot. You can do this by pressing the button with either your right or left index finger.
